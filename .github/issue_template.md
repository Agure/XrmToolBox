Before creating an issue, please ensure you are in the appropriate repository:
- for connectivity issue, please submit an issue in [MscrmTools.Xrm.Connection repository](https://github.com/MscrmTools/MscrmTools.Xrm.Connection/issues)
- for plugins issue, we only accept issue for plugins from MscrmTools that don't have their own repository (which are, as of today: MsCrmTools.FetchXmlTester, MsCrmTools.MetadataDocumentGenerator, MsCrmTools.SolutionImport and MsCrmTools.SynchronousEventOrderEditor). Any other plugin issue should be created on their respective repository
